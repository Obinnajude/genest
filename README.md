# genest
This is a practice folder for Generation USA Cybersecurity Analyst Cohort discord group
# The main purpose of learning git is for source code collaboration and source control. Lets create a real life scenario and practice git and python as we learn
There are two python files in the Src folder in this repo, the cal.py and quiz.py file.
# Activity One
In the cal.py file, you are required to contribute to the calculator project by adding a python function to perform the list calculation commented out in the file. Just chose one function and implement.

This will help us to practice the previous python class we did as well as git.

## Activity Two

The second file is quiz.py, simply read through the code in the file and see where a python dictionary is on the code that contains the quiz questions, add your own question and the answer to it using dictionary key value pair method. 
This second activity is if you don't feel like writing python code. It will help you practice git.
